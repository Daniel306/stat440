tidied rWishart algorithm:

def rWishart(n, df, Psi):
  d = dim(Psi)[0]
  assert d == dim(Psi)[1], "Psi must be square"
  #Unchecked: Psi must be positive definite
  
  gamma = chol(Psi)' #(the upper triangular cholesky factor)
  for k in range(n): #(loop to take samples)
    sample U[n] = Bartlett_factor(d, df) #in R's impl, this gives the upper triangle
                  #nb: W[n] := U[n]'*U[n] ~ W(I_d, df) 
    define U_s[n] = gamma*L[n] #scale L[n]; this makes  
    set V[n] = 
  return V

rWishart(n, df, Psi) :
 -> a terrible mixture of R, C and FORTRAN (from using LAPACK)

###XXX what order does C use? row-major or column-major? fortran and R use column-major order (R probably bc most of it was written against ancient fortran routines in the first place)

1) typechecks and declarations (in particular, ans is the 3d (d,d,n) array)
2) copy scCp = Psi (into a C/fortran array)
3) redefine scCp = chol(Psi)'  (by dpotrf.f with option "U" which makes it give the UPPER triangle)
4) for j = 1:n {
  
  4.1) std_rWishart_factor:
     construct tmp, the Bartlett's Method Factor  (this is what  does)
     
  4.2)  
  redefine tmp = scCp * tmp 
    ->(ie scale the Bartlett's factor from a W(I, df) dist to a W(Psi, df) dist)

  4.3) dsyrk(U,T) + for loops to fill in the gaps left by dsyrk
    construct ans[j] = tmp'*tmp   (NB: tmp = chol(psi)')
    
     (line by line: 
        construct ans[j] = dsyrk(T)(U)(tmp) (dsyrk(T)(U) gives a function that, give M, computes M'M ((if given N instead of T, instead computes MM')) is defined to give the upper part of tmp'*tmp)
        copy out lower triangle: for(i=1:d) { for(k=1:i) { .. }} 
  
       --> dsyrk.f doesn't bother to fill in the other triangle because that would be redundant because it knows this matrix is symmetric
        which is nice but like, you could give that as an option
