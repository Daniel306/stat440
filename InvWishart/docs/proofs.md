Proofs
=======

We require derivations (or maybe refutations) of these facts:

* Bartlett's Theorem: if A[i,i] ~ sqrt(X^2_{df-{i-1}}) && A[i,j] ~ N(0,1) and A[j,i] = 0 (i>j) then AA' ~ W(I, df)
* The Wishart linearity lemma: if M ~ W(V,df) then CWC' ~ W(CVC', df) (but only when squared like this)
* Facts about symmetric matrices
* Facts about positive definite matrices
* Uniqueness of the Cholesky Decomposition
* Lower * Lower = Lower and Upper*Upper = Upper but Lower*Upper = anything ((so lower*t(lower) = anything))
