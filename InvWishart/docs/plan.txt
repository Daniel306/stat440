Validation testing
 - Moments 
   - derive (in math and latex) the expected moments, check if we get them o
     (moments are handy because they are all expectations, which can be tested--by the law of large numbers--with taking sample means)
 - Marginals
   - k-s test?

Performance testing
 - cases: algorithm X impl
   
   impl: (
   python
   cython
   scipy with explicitly marking matrices as upper/lower triangular (see: ...)
   R
   R with explicitly marking matrices as upper/lower triangular (the functions 'backsolve' and 'forwardsolve' do this)
   Rcpp
   )
   algorithm: (
   naive
   snappysample
   factoredsnappysample (in which we only compute chol(Psi) once)
   )
