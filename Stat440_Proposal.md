In bayesian multivariate normal statistics, the Normal-Inverse-Wishart
distribution is the conjugate prior of the multivariate normal.
It is therefore the multivariate generalization of the
 Normal-Inverse-\Chi^2
distribution, which is the sampling distribution of a 

Implement the Normal-Inverse-Wishart distribution 
  (as density (dInvWishart(X, V, Mu, kappa, Psi, nu)) and sampling (rInvWishart(n, Mu, kappa, Psi, nu)))

 
Testing
 -> moments
 
Examples:
 -> Multivariable Regression
 -> Time Series via Hierarchical Normal Models
 
Tidy:
 -> put up docs? / get package into CRAN
